For my project I built a simple school administration website. The main pages include: student.html, assignments.html, classes.html, grade.html, myaccount.html, reports.html and logout.html. The site was built from scratch utilizing no frameworks or template code. The only external resource is the Font Awesome 5 icon library. The site features a collapseable navigation panel on the left. The "hamburger" button is actually a checkbox that has been styled with Font Awesome icons. The "hamburger" button defaults to a "-" icon allowing the user to minimize the navigation once familiar with the interface thus freeing up valuable screen realestate on small screens. The collape/expand state is maintained via use of local storage in the JavaScript.
